Assignment idea taken from Functional Programming course by Martin Odersky.

Write a function which verifies the balancing of parentheses in a string. For example, the function should return true for the following strings:
- (if (zero? x) max (/ 1 x))
- I told him (that it’s not (yet) done). (But he wasn’t listening)

The function should return false for the following strings:
- :-)
- ())(

The last example shows that it’s not enough to verify that a string contains the same number of opening and closing parentheses.


Extended case:
Add support for checking different types of brackets. For example, the function should return true for the following strings:
- [foo (bar {foo})]
- {{}[(){}]()}()

The function should return false for the following strings:
- [{()]}
- (([{]}))
