Katas
=====

This repository contains sources of various katas I performed.

For quick start with a new kata I use script which prepares folder structure and runs editor and continuous testing tool.

For example, to practice PrimeFactors kata in Ruby I run:

    ./start_ruby_kata PrimeFactors Factorer

This script creates basic source code folder structure and runs TextMate editor and Guard continuous testing tool.
